# Getting Started

!!! note
    Regardless if you're just curious, an implementer, or a developer... please review the introduction before continuing. We tried to keep it short.

I'm an **implementer**: The workflow and decision rules pages explain the basics and have links to resources to learn and teach others how to understand it and run it in an organization.

I'm a **developer** or **systems administrator**: The developer pages goes into more detail about how to demo and deploy the Client Registry.

I'm a **contributor**: This is a community project and meant for others to adopt to their use cases as they wish. The contributing page goes into how to make different types of contributions.
